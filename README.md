# Cross-Modal Knowledge Guided Model for Abstractive Summarization

This repository contains the paper and a proof-of-concept implementation of the **Cross-modal Knowledge guided Model (CKGM)** for abstractive text summarization.

## 1. The Paper

**Title:** "Cross-modal knowledge guided model for abstractive summarization"
**Published in:** Complex & Intelligent Systems (2024)

### Key Contributions

The paper addresses a critical flaw in abstractive summarization: the generation of factually inconsistent or fabricated information. It proposes a novel model, CKGM, that mitigates this by grounding the summarization process in a richer, cross-modal context.

The core innovations are:

*   **Multimodal Knowledge Graph (MKG):** Instead of relying solely on text, the model constructs a knowledge graph that fuses factual information from both the source text and associated images. This provides a more robust and verified source of information.
*   **Cross-Modal Factual Verification:** By linking textual entities (e.g., people, places) with visual information, the model can better verify facts and relationships before generating the summary.
*   **Guided BERT Summarization:** The MKG is embedded into a pre-trained language model (BERT), guiding it to produce summaries that are not only fluent but also factually consistent with the source material.
*   **Entity Memory Embedding:** An efficient memory algorithm is proposed to accelerate model training and improve the fusion of information.

The paper demonstrates through extensive experiments on datasets like CNN/DailyMail and MSCOCO that the CKGM model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both factual consistency and summary quality (ROUGE scores).

## 2. The Code

The `Cross-Modal.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook provides a high-level, proof-of-concept implementation of the CKGM architecture.

### Implementation Details

*   **Frameworks:** The code is written in Python using `PyTorch`, the `transformers` library for BERT, and `torch_geometric` for graph-based components.
*   **Structure:** It correctly scaffolds the main modules described in the paper, including the `TextEncoder`, `ImageProcessor`, `MKGConstructor`, and a custom `CKGMBert` model.
*   **Status:** The code is a **simplified sketch** and not a production-level implementation. It demonstrates the overall data flow and architecture but omits many of the complex, lower-level details of the paper, particularly in graph construction, knowledge fusion, and data processing.

### How to Use

This notebook can be used as a starting point for understanding and experimenting with the core concepts of the CKGM model. To replicate the paper's results, a more detailed implementation of the graph construction and knowledge fusion mechanisms would be required.

## 3. Next Steps

The next steps for this project are:
1.  To fully implement the complex graph construction and knowledge fusion mechanisms described in the paper.
2.  To integrate the model with the datasets used in the paper (e.g., CNN/DailyMail, MSCOCO).
3.  To train and evaluate the model to replicate the paper's results.
4.  To explore the model's potential for other natural language generation tasks.
